# Diabetes Analysis


This is the first data set that I have tried to analyse using appropriate regressions and more will follow.


This project focuses on analyzing diabetes data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. The primary objective is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable, indicating the presence of diabetes.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. In this project, KNN is used to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on their medical measurements.

### How KNN Works

- **Objective**: Determine the group of a new data point based on previously obtained points.
- **Process**:
  1. Identify the `K` nearest neighbor points.
  2. Determine the most common group among these neighbors.
  3. Assign the new point to this group.

- **Distance Calculation**: KNN uses the Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between points.

## Example

An example of using the KNN model in this project:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np

# Load your dataset
X = np.array([[1.5, 2.3], [3.1, 4.2], [1.2, 1.9], [5.1, 3.3]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])

# Create the KNN model
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Fit the model
knn.fit(X, y)

# Predict a new data point
new_point = np.array([[2.0, 2.5]])
prediction = knn.predict(new_point)

print("Predicted class:", prediction)
```

## Results

The results section should summarize the findings and accuracy of the model. Include visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, or any other relevant metrics.
